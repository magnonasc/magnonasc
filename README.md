# Welcome!

I'm a software engineer with 7+ years of experience. I worked with some critical and high scale applications. 
I'm also very generalist, not minding if I have to work with different technologies or even learn new ones to get the job done.
I have a good comprehension about good practices and testing and I always focus on delivering high quality applications.
